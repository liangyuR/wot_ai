# High-performance screen capture (Windows)
dxcam>=0.0.5

# Image encoding (PNG format, using OpenCV - built-in)
# Note: turbojpeg-python is no longer used (only supports JPEG)
# PNG provides lossless quality, larger file size but better for processing
# Optional: Pillow-SIMD for faster PNG encoding (if needed)
# Pillow-SIMD>=10.0.0

# Game state detection (choose one or both):
# Option 1: YOLO-based detection (recommended, faster and more stable)
ultralytics>=8.0.0
# Option 2: OCR-based detection (legacy, slower)
# easyocr
# pytesseract

# Optional (only needed for window-capture mode via external utils)
# psutil
# pywin32
